# Airlines-System
Abstract:
As this program deals with the booking of tickets by the customers. The program generates a ticket for each customer and gives its status. As there is a limited number of seats the status of ticket goes from confirmed  to  waiting       status, when it exceeds its limit.
Then the system asks for customerâ€™s personal details and also the number of passenger boarding and according to that the system generates the total amount to be paid and at the end generates the complete ticket of the passenger.
